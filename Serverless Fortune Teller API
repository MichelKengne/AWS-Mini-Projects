Project: Serverless Fortune Teller API  

Inspired by: Tech by Lucie YouTube tutorial  

Tech Stacks:
- Python 3.10  
- AWS Lambda  
- Amazon API Gateway (HTTP API)

Project Overview
A simple serverless fortune teller that answers any question with "Yes", "No", or "Maybe". Built using AWS Lambda for the backend logic and API Gateway to expose it as a public HTTP endpoint.

Implementation Steps

1. Created AWS Lambda Function  
   - Navigated to AWS Lambda → Create function → Author from scratch.  
   - Named the function and selected Python runtime.  
   - Wrote Python code using `random` module to generate random responses.  
   - Used the default settings. 
   - Imported `random` and defined a list of possible answers (e.g., "Yes", "No", "Maybe", "Ask again later").  
   - Implemented `lambda_handler` to accept input (optional question) and return a random answer in JSON format.
   - Python code: 
import random

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    question = event.get("question", "")
    answers = ["Yes", "No", "Maybe"]
    return {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "body": {
            "question": question,
            "answer": random.choice(answers)
        }
    }

2. Set Up API Gateway  
   - Created a new HTTP API in API Gateway.  
   - Added a route: GET.  
   - Integrated with my existing Lambda function using management integration.
   - Deployed the API.  
   - Obtained the public Invoke URL: https://23toybbo98.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/

3. Testing
   - Tested the endpoint using browser. 
   - Unfortunately received an error: {"message":"Internal Server Error"}

NB: Still trying to troubleshoot this error
