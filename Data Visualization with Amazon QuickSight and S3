Amazon S3 (data storage)
Amazon QuickSight (data visualization)
JSON manifest file for connecting S3 data

Project Overview
Visualized a dataset (Amazon-Bestsellers-Dataset.csv) by storing it in S3, configuring a manifest.json file to point to the data, and creating interactive dashboards in QuickSight.

Steps Completed in Amazon S3:

1. Downloaded the dataset (CSV) and sample manifest.json from the tutorial resources.
2. Created an S3 bucket and uploaded the dataset (CSV) file and manifest.json file.
3. Edited manifest.json locally: Updated the URI(s) to point to the S3 location of the dataset (s3://best-seller-bucketv1/Amazon-Bestsellers-Dataset.csv).
4. Uploaded the updated manifest.json to the same S3 bucket.

In Amazon QuickSight:

1. Modified the permission to grant Amazon QuickSight access to my S3 bucket (best-seller-bucketv1)
2. Created a new dataset → Selected S3 data source.
3. Provided the S3 URL of the manifest.json file.
4. Imported data into SPICE and prepared fields.
5. Built visualizations (charts, tables) and created a dashboard for insights.
6.Tested and explored the interactive dashboard.


Result:
Successful end-to-end data visualization pipeline using serverless AWS services. Gained hands-on experience with S3 manifest files and QuickSight dashboards.
